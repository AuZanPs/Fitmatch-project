### 2. Environment Setup

#### Client Environment
Copy the client environment template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Edit `server/.env` and add your API keys:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-gemini-api-key
```

Note: Never commit real API keys to Git. The repository contains placeholder values only.

### 3. Supabase Setup

#### Create Supabase Project
1. Go to supabase.com and create a new project
2. Get your project URL and anon key from Settings → API

#### Database Setup

2. Copy and run the contents of `complete-database-setup.sql`
3. This creates all tables, indexes, and security policies

#### Storage Setup
1. Go to Storage in Supabase dashboard
2. Create a bucket named `clothing-images`
3. Set it to public access for image serving

### 4. Google Gemini Setup
1. Go to Google AI Studio
